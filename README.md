# BlackJack
Find out if you're good or not at blackjack... I'll even count cards for you.

The idea is similar to how roulette works, usually casinos tell you what the previous winning numbers are, it gives people a sense of transparency when statistically speaking, roulette spins are completely independent events from each other.

On the other hand, black jack hands are NOT independent events from each other. What cards have been drawn previously affect what cards might be drawn next (unless continuous shuffling machines are being used). This means that card counting is a valid strategy to decrease the house edge, or even start consistently winning.

This blackjack game will keep the count for you, to practice or to test out different strategies, although I believe at the end of the day it is still gambling, and people on the long run will lose.
